⚙️ How It Works
SpoFree functions as a client that fetches lossless audio directly from TIDAL's catalogue.

SpoFree utilizes a HiFi API to find and fetch high-fidelity, lossless songs.

The specific API instances are sourced from open-source projects like the list found here.

When you search for a track and click it, the API provides a direct TIDAL link/stream for the lossless audio, which SpoFree then plays.

🚀 Deployment
You can deploy your own instance of SpoFree easily and for free on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
